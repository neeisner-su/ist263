With a strong set of computer skills and unparalleled attention to detail, I can navigate through various technological platforms. I am also creative and a problem solver which enables me to complete complex challenges. My strong sense of team-work allows me to work effectively with diverse groups in a professional setting. Outside of work, I love going to the gym, traveling with my family, spending time with friends, and watching movies. I am also extremely passionate about fashion and always make sure to keep up to date with new trends!
